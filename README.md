In this Jupyter notebook I present a method to get the Tofts model parameters from DCE-MRI images.

The parameters are obtained by solving a single linear system of equations which allows to include a spatial regularization.

The method is tested using brain DRO from Bosca et al. 2016. 

# Instructions:

Uncompress the file MRI.7z to create a folder MRI, inside all .dcm image files. 

Then execute the Jupyter notebook ExtendedToftsModelTool.ipynb
